            some items could hold a special meaning to you 
            because of who you received it from. these are 
            my keys, but I received the vivienne westwood 
            keychain from a high school friend for my birthday, 
            before I left for college. every time i look at it, 
            i think of her, and all the memories weâ€™ve had together 
            back in high school.
